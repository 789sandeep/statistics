# Q3. What are the different types of data and how do they differ from each other? Provide an example of each type of data.
# There are four main types of data: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.

# Nominal data: Nominal data is categorical data where the values are just names or labels with no numerical order or meaning. Nominal data is used to identify or classify things based on some characteristics.
# Example: Gender is nominal data, where the categories are male and female.

# Ordinal data: Ordinal data is categorical data that has some order or ranking. The categories have a relative position or rank, but the differences between them may not be equal.
# Example: Education level is ordinal data, where the categories are high school diploma, bachelor's degree, master's degree, and doctoral degree.

# Interval data: Interval data is numerical data that has equal intervals between the values, but there is no true zero point. The values can be negative or positive, but zero does not represent an absence of the measured quantity.
# Example: Temperature is interval data because it is measured on a scale with equal intervals between the values, but zero degrees does not represent an absence of temperature.

# Ratio data: Ratio data is numerical data that has a true zero point, where zero means an absence of the measured quantity. Ratio data has equal intervals between the values, and the values can be negative or positive.
# Example: Height is ratio data because it has a true zero point (i.e., a height of zero means no height), and the values are measured on a scale with equal intervals between the values.
