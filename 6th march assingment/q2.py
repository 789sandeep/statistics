# Q2. Define the different types of statistics and give an example of when each type might be used.
# ANS.2.
# Descriptive statistics: Descriptive statistics is used to summarize and describe the main features of a data set. It includes measures of central tendency, such as mean, median, and mode, which provide a summary of the typical or average value of a variable in a dataset. Descriptive statistics also includes measures of variability, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, which provide information about how spread out the data is.
# Example: Suppose a researcher wants to summarize the exam scores of a group of students. They can use descriptive statistics to calculate the mean, median, and mode of the scores, as well as the range, variance, and standard deviation. This information can help the researcher to understand the overall performance of the students and to identify any outliers or patterns in the data.

# Inferential statistics: Inferential statistics is used to make predictions or draw conclusions about a population based on a sample of data. It involves estimating population parameters from sample statistics, and testing hypotheses about the population based on the sample data.
# Example: Suppose a company wants to know the average salary of all software engineers in the United States. They can't ask every software engineer for their salary, so they take a sample of 1000 engineers and use inferential statistics to estimate the population mean. They can also test hypotheses, such as whether the average salary of software engineers in California is different from the average salary of software engineers in New York. Inferential statistics can help the company to make data-driven decisions about hiring and compensation.
