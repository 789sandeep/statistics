# Q10. What are some common measures of central tendency and variability used in statistics? Explain how each measure can be used to describe a dataset.

# There are several common measures of central tendency and variability used in statistics. These measures provide a way to describe the main features of a dataset, including its central location, spread, and shape.

# Measures of central tendency include the mean, median, and mode:

# Mean: The mean is the average value of a dataset, calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of observations. The mean is a useful measure of central tendency when the data are normally distributed, as it represents the point of balance for the dataset.

# Median: The median is the middle value of a dataset when the values are arranged in order. The median is a useful measure of central tendency when the data are skewed or have extreme values, as it is not affected by outliers.

# Mode: The mode is the most common value in a dataset. The mode is a useful measure of central tendency when the data are categorical or have discrete values.

# Measures of variability include the range, interquartile range (IQR), variance, and standard deviation:

# Range: The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. The range is a simple measure of variability, but it can be affected by extreme values.

# Interquartile range (IQR): The IQR is the range of values that contains the middle 50% of the dataset. The IQR is a useful measure of variability when the data are skewed or have outliers.

# Variance: The variance measures the spread of the data around the mean. It is calculated by taking the sum of the squared differences between each value and the mean, divided by the number of observations minus one.

# Standard deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It measures the average distance that each value in the dataset is from the mean. The standard deviation is a useful measure of variability when the data are normally distributed.

# In summary, measures of central tendency and variability provide a way to describe the main features of a dataset, including its central location, spread, and shape. These measures can be used to summarize and compare datasets, identify outliers, and make inferences about the population from a sample of data.
