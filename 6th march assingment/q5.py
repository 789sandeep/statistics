# Q5. Explain the concept of levels of measurement and give an example of a variable for each level.

# Levels of measurement refer to the different ways in which data can be measured or classified. There are four main levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.

# Nominal level of measurement: Nominal level of measurement is the lowest level of measurement, where the data is categorized or classified based on names, labels, or categories. The categories have no order or hierarchy, and there is no meaningful numerical value associated with the categories.
# Example: Eye color is a nominal variable because the categories (e.g. blue, brown, green) have no hierarchy or order, and there is no meaningful numerical value associated with each category.

# Ordinal level of measurement: Ordinal level of measurement is the level of measurement where the data can be categorized and ranked or ordered. The categories have a relative position or rank, but the differences between them may not be equal.
# Example: Educational level is an ordinal variable because the categories (e.g. high school diploma, bachelor's degree, master's degree) can be ranked or ordered, but the difference between each category is not necessarily the same.

# Interval level of measurement: Interval level of measurement is the level of measurement where the data can be measured on a scale with equal intervals between the values, but there is no true zero point. The values can be negative or positive, but zero does not represent an absence of the measured quantity.
# Example: Temperature is an interval variable because it is measured on a scale with equal intervals between the values, but zero degrees does not represent an absence of temperature.

# Ratio level of measurement: Ratio level of measurement is the highest level of measurement, where the data can be measured on a scale with equal intervals between the values, and there is a true zero point. The values can be negative or positive, but zero represents an absence of the measured quantity.
# Example: Height is a ratio variable because it has a true zero point (i.e., a height of zero means no height), and the values are measured on a scale with equal intervals between the values.
