# Q12. For a normal distribution data what is the relationship between its measure of central tendency?

# For a normal distribution, the three measures of central tendency (i.e., the mean, median, and mode) are equal. This means that the center of the distribution, as measured by these three statistics, is at the same point.

# This is a property of the normal distribution that makes it easy to describe and analyze using these measures. In a normal distribution, the mean is equal to the median, which is equal to the mode. This is because the normal distribution is symmetric around its mean, with half the data points on either side. Therefore, the median (which is the point that divides the data into two equal parts) is also at the mean. Additionally, because the normal distribution is unimodal (i.e., has a single peak), the mode is also at the mean.

# In summary, for a normal distribution, the three measures of central tendency are equal and located at the same point, which is the mean of the distribution.
