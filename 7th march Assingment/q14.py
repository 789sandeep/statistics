#Q14. How do outliers affect measures of central tendency and dispersion? Provide an example.

# Outliers can have a significant effect on measures of central tendency and dispersion, particularly on the mean and standard deviation.

# For example, consider a dataset of test scores for a class of students:

a=80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125
#The mean for this dataset is 100, which is a reasonable representation of the "typical" score in the dataset. However, if we add an outlier to this dataset:

b=80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 200
#The mean for this dataset jumps to 116.4, which is much higher than the "typical" score in the dataset. This is because the outlier (200) is much larger than the other scores in the dataset and has a disproportionate effect on the mean.

# Similarly, outliers can also have a significant effect on measures of dispersion such as the range and standard deviation. In the example above, the range for the first dataset is 45 (125 - 80), which is a reasonable representation of the spread of the dataset. However, when we add the outlier to the dataset, the range jumps to 120 (200 - 80), which is much larger than the spread of the other scores in the dataset. This is because the outlier is much farther from the other scores in the dataset and increases the overall spread of the data.

# Therefore, outliers can have a significant effect on measures of central tendency and dispersion, particularly on the mean and standard deviation. It is important to identify and handle outliers appropriately to avoid skewing the results of statistical analysis.
