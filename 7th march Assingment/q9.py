# Q9. If a data is right skewed then what will be the position of median with respect to mean?

# If a data is right-skewed, then the median will be less than the mean. This is because the skewness in the data is caused by a few very high values that are pulling the mean up, while the majority of the data is concentrated on the lower end of the distribution. As a result, the mean is higher than the median.

# To illustrate this, consider the following example: suppose we have a dataset of incomes for a group of people, and the distribution is right-skewed, with a few people having very high incomes. In this case, the mean income would be higher than the median income, since the high incomes of a few individuals would pull up the mean, while the majority of the people have lower incomes.

# In general, the position of the median with respect to the mean depends on the shape of the distribution. In a symmetrical distribution, the mean and median are the same, while in a skewed distribution, the mean and median are different, and the direction and degree of skewness determine their relative position
