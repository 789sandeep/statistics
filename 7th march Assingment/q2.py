# Q2. What is the difference between the mean, median, and mode? How are they used to measure the
# central tendency of a dataset?

# The mean, median, and mode are all measures of central tendency that describe the typical or representative value of a dataset. However, they differ in how they are calculated and what aspects of the dataset they emphasize.

# The mean is the sum of all the values in a dataset divided by the number of values in the dataset. It represents the average value of the dataset and is sensitive to extreme values or outliers. The mean is often used as a measure of central tendency when the data is normally distributed or symmetrical.

# The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in order from smallest to largest. It represents the value that divides the dataset into two equal parts, and is not affected by extreme values or outliers. The median is often used as a measure of central tendency when the data is skewed or contains outliers.

# The mode is the value in a dataset that appears most frequently. It represents the most common value in the dataset and is not affected by extreme values or outliers. The mode is often used as a measure of central tendency for categorical or discrete data.

# To measure the central tendency of a dataset, one or more of these measures can be used depending on the nature of the data and the research question. In general, the mean is preferred when the data is normally distributed, the median is preferred when the data is skewed or contains outliers, and the mode is preferred for categorical or discrete data. However, all three measures can be used to provide a more complete picture of the central tendency of a dataset.
